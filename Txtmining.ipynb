       "\" LEAD: Governor Cuomo, with a possible Presidential campaign waiting in the wings, took the oath of office New Year's Eve for a second term as New York's chief executive. LEAD: Governor Cuomo, with a possible Presidential campaign waiting in the wings, took the oath of office New Year's Eve for a second term as New York's chief executive. Governor Cuomo, with a possible Presidential campaign waiting in the wings, took the oath of office New Year's Eve for a second term as New York's chief executive. The official oath was administered to Mr. Cuomo by Sol Wachtler, Chief Judge of New York State, during a private ceremony tonight at the Governor's Mansion. ''What we have to do now is spend four more years trying to provide other people in this state with the kind of magnificent opportunities that we've had,'' Mr. Cuomo told a small group of friends and relatives after taking his oath. ''We worked very hard the last four years, we'll work even harder in the four years ahead.'' Before taking his oath of office, Mr. Cuomo, a licensed notary public, swore in his new lieutenant governor, Stan Lundine. While the two Democrats took their official oaths of office on New Year's Eve to meet requirements of the state constitution, a public inauguration ceremony was to be held on New Year's Day at the Empire State Plaza adjacent to the State Capitol. State workers were busy today putting up the last of the red, white and blue bunting for the event. Mr. Cuomo spent some time in the Convention Center hall practicing his speech. Mr. Cuomo said a few days after his re-election that he was going to begin thinking about running for President. He has yet to announce any decision. Nonetheless, just before the ceremony tonight, aides to the Governor said that he would be traveling to five other states, including Iowa, in the next several months. Iowa is the site of the nation's first Presidential party caucuses. Cuomo also plans to travel to California, Florida, Louisiana and North Carolina, said a spokesman, Martin Steadman.\""

But under conditions set by  citys chief lawyer   outside lawyers will work without pay and will cooperate with lawyers in his office.   Continuing a break with Mayor Koch   seven or members of  Board of Estimate yesterday retained private counsel to appeal a Federal court ruling against  makeup of  board. But under conditions set by  citys chief lawyer   outside lawyers will work without pay and will cooperate with lawyers in his office. Continuing a break with Mayor Koch   seven or members of  Board of Estimate yesterday retained private counsel to appeal a Federal court ruling against  makeup of  board. But under conditions set by  citys chief lawyer   outside lawyers will work without pay and will cooperate with lawyers in his office. Corporation Counsel Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr.   who  as  citys lawyer  has  authority to determine what role  if any  private lawyers can play in lawsuits involving  city  said last night that he had rejected efforts by  seven board members to hire independent counsel and file a separate appeal. Instead   private lawyers  who will represent all  board members but  Mayor  will be designated special chief assistant corporation counsel  and will file a joint appeals brief with  city  according to Mr. Schwarz. But one of  board members who met yesterday with Simon H. Rifkind  a former Federal judge who is  lead outside counsel  said that it had not yet been determined wher one brief or two would be filed. Koch Using City Lawyers It appeared  n  that re was some confusion about  role of Judge Rifkind and his associates in  law firm of Paul  Weiss  Rifkind  Wharton & Garrison. Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin  City Council President Andrew J. Stein and  five borough presidents met without Mr. Kochs knowledge on Dec. 19 to talk about hiring a private firm to represent m instead of  Corporation Counsel  who  under  City Charter  normally handles all such cases. Mr. Koch continues to be represented only by  city lawyers and does not plan  he said last night  to join with his colleagues in any separate legal action. The board members have said y wanted ir own lawyers because y were not convinced that  Mayor was committed to retaining  boards makeup and powers. But Mr. Schwarz  who has submitted his resignation to return to private practice  said last night he told  board members that he would not agree to let m proceed independently. There was  he added  no basic conflict between  Mayors position and irs about how to pursue  appeal  which stems from a ruling that  boards voting structure is unconstitutional because it violates  one man  one vote principle. Compromise Reached The board members   who stand to lose ir jobs  or at least some of ir powers  if y lose  appeal   still wanted to hire outside counsel  so Mr. Schwarz came up with a compromise. They are in effect  going to help us write a good brief  he said of  private lawyers. I thought it was foolish to have an ideological fight with m. If you can reach a practical result without an ideological argument  its always preferable. board of estimate  minus koch  retains private counsel for appeal about politics and government   SUITS AND CLAIMS AGAINST GOVERNMENT and  CONSTITUTIONS'"
